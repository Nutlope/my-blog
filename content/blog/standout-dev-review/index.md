As I was reading [The Standout Developer](https://www.thestandoutdeveloper.com/), a book about taking your developer career to the next level, I created a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Nutlope/status/1297929885659398145) of my top takeaways from the book. It got some attention, so I decided to write a blog post where I can focus on the top 5 and expand on them some more.

## Takeaway #1: Pick a niche and own it

There are many schools of thought for whether you should specialize in one technology or stay a generalist. No matter what you believe in, the basic truth is that your market value increases when you specialize.

The author tells her story about specializing in blockchain, becoming suffeciently good enough in it, writing blog posts / speaking at meetups, and eventually authoring a blockchain O'Reilly book.

The 5 steps to accomplishing this are:

1. Learn about something specific and become good at it
2. Share your knowledge publicly (blogs/Twitter/YouTube)
3. Consistently provide value & become known as an expert
4. Apply to speak at conferences
5. Write a book on it

Here's the kicker: You don't have to do blockchain (or whatever you decide to specialize in) forever. Similar to the author, you may do it for 1-2 years then get bored of it, and move on to the next thing that excites you.

The best part? Your reputation travels with you regardless of what you decide to specialize in.

## Takeaway #2: How to do well on Twitter

Twitter is one of the best ways to network online as a developer. If you manage to build up a community of mentors and friends, .

One piece of advice the author gives is that you should know your audience and tailor your tweets. Think to yourself about what topics you want to tweet about and the type of people you want to attract. This may take some trial and error but once you figure it out, it becomes easier to create tweets that add value since you're writing for a specific group of people.

Another interesting piece of advice is to answer DMs to help others and try to commit time every now and then to benefit the community (Randall did it through offering free personalized resume reviews).

Tweet about anything that you feel can help others in some way. Tweet about something new you've learned that made you go, "Wow I wish I knew that before". The general rule of thumb is don't tweet if you're not adding value.

## Takeaway #3: The power of documentation

Reading without taking notes:

We forget the vast majority of what we read. Unless we are proactive in taking notes when we're learning, then periodically revisiting those notes to better rememeber concepts, we usually completely forget it (unless you're using it daily). The author tells some stories of how
